# NSA Werewolf - LICENCE

The set of rules was found at a [page from the university of auckland](http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/nsa_werewolf.txt)
There is no Licence file given, but some kind of sharable licence is assumed.

The set of playing cards was added by me. Copying and modifying is permitted. Some form of backling and resharing changes is welcome.
