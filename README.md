# NSA Werewolf - README

This is a set of rules of the werewolf game, were the werewolves have been replaced by the NSA and the other special roles by people from the whole affair.

The set of rules was found at a [page from the university of auckland](http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/pubs/nsa_werewolf.txt)
There is no Licence file given, but some kind of sharable licence is assumed.

A set of playing cards was produced using yEd.
